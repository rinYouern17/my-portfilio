          I am YOUERN RIN, a Professional Web Developer with a passion for technology. My journey started at Tmro Meal Secondary School, where I discovered my love for tech and teamwork. I then went on to complete my BacII Certificate at Banteay Chhmar High School, which gave me a strong academic foundation.

          Currently, I am studying for an Association Degree at Passerelles num√©riques Cambodia. Here, I am learning and improving my skills in various technical areas like SQL Server, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Node.js, MySQL, Laravel, and Vue.js. Alongside these hard skills, I have developed important soft skills such as communication, punctuality, honesty, responsibility, time management, task management, teamwork, problem-solving, critical thinking, and self-learning.

          In my free time, I enjoy playing football and volleyball, learning new skills, reading books, researching, and coding. These activities help me stay balanced and motivated.

          As a web developer, I aim to create websites and applications that are easy to use, look great, and work well. I love taking on new challenges and am always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies. My goal is to make a positive impact in the digital world by delivering high-quality solutions that meet the needs of users and businesses.
